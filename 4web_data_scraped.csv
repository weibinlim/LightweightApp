Coca-Cola has been consistently ranked as the top soft drink brand worldwide, with a global brand value of over 98 billion U.S. dollars. Other soft drink brands manufactured and sold by the Coca-Cola Company include Diet Coke, Sprite, and Fanta. What is often surprising to consumers is that the non-alcoholic beverage giant is also a key figure outside the soft drinks segment. In the United States, for example, the company is also part of the top four brands in the ready-to-drink iced coffee market.\n\n\n\nA closer look: the performance of the Coca-Cola Company\nThe Cola-Cola Company\u2019s revenue has fluctuated globally in recent years, reaching around 46 billion U.S. dollars in their most recent financial year.

With its market value, the multinational food and beverage company PepsiCo directly follows Coca-Cola in the . Even in the beverage market, which both companies are best known for, Pepsi can't hold a candle to Coca-Cola, reaching a brand value of only approximately 19 billion U.S. dollars. In fact, it's food that is the for the company. From what was initially a balanced beverage-to-food ratio, this development has slowly become apparent lately, and is now at roughly 40 to 60 percent. According to PepsiCo's most recent annual report, the of approximately 92 billion U.S. dollars worldwide. At the same time, it of around nine billion U.S. dollars. When it comes to advertising campaigns, the two brands also compete. Over the years, both have repeatedly run campaigns in which they make fun of their opponents. From Coca-Cola with the claim \"It's a real thing\" to PepsiCo with the advertising in which both colas were tasted blind and Pepsi won every time. In this way, PepsiCo tries to assert itself against the cola giant and a constant creative back and forth arises from which both companies benefit.\nThe beverage industry has been greatly impacted by the rivalry between the two companies, which has encouraged both corporations to innovate and improve their products.
