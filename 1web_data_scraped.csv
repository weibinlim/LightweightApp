In 2022, Coca-Cola US was the 28th biggest company in the world by market valuation, and the leader in the specific category of carbonated soft drinks. In 2021, it was estimated to have a brand value of nearly $82 billion, more than double its 2006 valuation! \nSource\nDespite the legendary secrecy surrounding the Coca-Cola recipe, the brand\u2019s astronomical success since the invention of the soft drink in 1886 is no secret. In fact, the Coke logo is one of the most famous in the world, reportedly recognized by 94% of the world\u2019s population.\nA thorough analysis of the Coke brand and Coca-Cola target market segments can help explain the reasons behind this. Let\u2019s take a look at who is the Coke target audience, how does Coca-Cola segment their market, and why Coca-Cola customers love the brand experience so much.\nWant to learn more?\nWho is Coca-Cola\u2019s target market?\nCoca-Cola is a global brand, appealing to a worldwide audience. The Coca-Cola target consumer is both male and female, covering almost the entire socio-economic spectrum, from average to high income earners. \nThe typical Coca-Cola consumer demographics are extremely broad in age, from young through middle aged, who can relate to the well-defined Coke brand identity that promises a vibe of youthfulness, fun, adventure and authenticity. \nThe Coca-Cola target market focuses on an older demographic specifically with the popular Diet Coke product, which offers a sugar-free option for diabetics and health-conscious consumers. \nThe broad target market of the Coca-Cola brand is also reflected in the range of packaging sizes and styles that cater to families, celebrations and on-the-go consumption of smaller bottles and cans.\n  Coca-Cola Target Market Segmentation\nA deeper dive into the Coca-Cola target market, focusing on the demographic, geographic, behavioral and psychographic segmentation, can provide helpful Coca-Cola consumer insights for brands targeting a similar audience. Let\u2019s explore each Coca-Cola market segmentation in turn.\nCoca-Cola Demographic Segmentation\nCoca-Cola demographics segmentation includes a broad age range of younger to mid-life consumers, from 10 to 40 years old. This demographic covers kids and teens, singles, younger adults still living at home and those who live alone, newly marrieds, married couples without kids, with young children or with kids in their teen years. \nThe employment profile of the Coke audience includes students, employees and professionals alike.\nCoca-Cola Geographic Segmentation\nThe Coca-Cola target audience is located all over the world, and the typical Coke consumers may live in urban centers or rural settings. \nInterestingly, EMEA leads in unit sales of Coca-Cola products, with 28% share in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, compared to 20% unit sales volume from the US. This is despite the fact that North America accounted for the largest revenue distribution share of the Coca-Cola company in 2021 (34.1% of all worldwide revenue). \n  Source\nCoca-Cola Behavioral Segmentation\nThe target market enjoys Coke for several reasons, including its good taste and refreshing feel, spending time with people, and as part of a general lifestyle habit. \nThe target audience of Coca-Cola consumes the product regularly, including \u2018soft\u2019 loyal users who enjoy Coke from time to time, and \u2018hard\u2019 loyal users, who drink Coke on a more routine basis. \nThe Coke target market can be broadly defined as having easygoing, ambitious, and determined personalities.\nCoca-Cola Psychographic Segmentation \nA Coca-Cola customer analysis from a psychographic standpoint shows a wide socio-economic breakdown, from working class to middle and upper class. This target audience tends to fall into the categories of \u2018aspirer\u2019, \u2018explorer\u2019 or \u2018succeeder\u2019. \nThe Coke targeting approach also has a strong focus on what\u2019s known as the \u201cconscious progressive\u201d personality type \u2013 consumers who value independence, learning, personal growth and being true to oneself, and who seek out those traits and experiences in the brands they consume. \n  Who are Coca-Cola\u2019s competitors? \nThere can be no competitor analysis of Coca-Cola without exploring the \u201cCola Wars\u201d, the ongoing battle for market share between Coke vs Pepsi sales. The difference between Coke and Pepsi has been hotly debated for decades, and Pepsi\u2019s audience is a key target market that Coca-Cola aspires to grab away from its number one competitor.\nAt the height of the Cola Wars, Pepsi conducted blind taste tests that proved that consumers preferred Pepsi over Coke. However, the Coca-Cola brand fought back, launching the \u201cNew Coke\u201d flavor, which flopped in the market and sent Pepsi sales soaring. Pepsi\u2019s victory was short lived, though, and Coke vs Pepsi market share has risen in the decades since, with Coca-Cola securing the top spot as the most popular cola soft drink. \nIn 2020, Coca-Cola was the top carbonated soft drink company in the US, with a volume share of 44.9% compared to PepsiCo, which trailed in second place with just 25.9%. \nAlthough Coke vs Pepsi products is the toughest battle among Coca-Cola competitors, Coke also competes against other cola and soft drink brands, such as Red Bull, Tetra Pak juice cartons, and Keurig Dr Pepper (7Up, Schweppes, Dr Pepper, RC, Sunkist and more). Yet Coca-Cola is the clear winner, with a brand value five times higher than the closest competitor. \nSource\n  What is Coca-Cola\u2019s Marketing Strategy?\nFor a company that has been operating for over a century, Coca-Cola marketing strategy is suitably broad, well established and highly successful. Coca-Cola takes a vast, multi channel marketing approach, focusing on TV ads, sponsorships, celebrity endorsements, product marketing, brand marketing and much more.\nMost importantly, Coca-Cola marketing focuses on selling a lifestyle promise, rather than simply a product. This is evident in the brand\u2019s slogans throughout the years, such as \u201cCoke is it\u201d, \u201cTaste the feeling\u201d, \u201cThe real thing\u201d, and the new 2021 slogan, \u201cReal Magic\u201d. \nThe vibe of the latest slogan is portrayed in the impressive 2022 Coca-Cola ad, \u201cThe Conductor \u2013 A Kind of Magic\u201d, featuring a roundup of artists performing the Coke jingle, promoting the Coke brand value of unity and feeling \u201cin sync\u201d:\nLike rival brand Pepsi, Coca-Cola also places a strong emphasis on product innovation. A recent example is the launch of Coca-Cola with Coffee,  touted as a hybrid mocha flavored caffeinated soft drink that falls into the ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee category.\nThe product is already showing strong success, with 88% of the customers who tried it saying they would buy it again. \nWhen it comes to the international markets, the company invests significantly in separate marketing campaigns. The Coca-Cola advertising strategy takes the strong brand message of Coke and localizes it for appropriate geos and target audiences. \nFor example, a recent ad for Coke India explores a new way to cheer for your team at a cricket match. Once again, the brand is focusing on themes of unity, togetherness and fun, which always take center stage no matter how does Coca-Cola market their products:\nInnovative and engaging campaigns are a key part of the Coca-Cola marketing strategy and brand approach, the most famous being \u201cShare a Coke\u201d, the personalized Coke bottle campaign. Launched in 2011 in Australia followed by worldwide expansion, the campaign has been a phenomenal success, producing over 150M bottles, increasing sales in the US by 2.5%, and garnering over a billion impressions of the #Shareacoke hashtag on social media. It also won several prestigious Cannes Lions awards for the Coke brand.\nLooking for insights like these for your target market?
